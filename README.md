### Hi there, I am Tamara ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Brazilian Software Engineer with over 4 years of experience in Full-Stack Development, with a focus on front-end technologies.

Since 2020, I've been working remotely as a Front-end Developer. My current tech stack includes TypeScript, Angular, C#, and .NET. I am also passionate about exploring new technologies and occasionally work with React, React Native, Next.js, and Node.js.

Most of my code and contributions are in private repositories on other platforms, as I work with financial institutions and must comply with the LGPD (General Data Protection Law).

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!
