### Hi there, I am Tamara ðŸ‘‹

I am a Brazilian Software Engineer with over 4 years of experience in Full-Stack Development, front-end focused.

After acquiring experience in Customer Success working with global teams for clients like Microsoft Xbox, I attended Le Wagon's coding Bootcamp in Lisbon (Portugal) to understand the programming universe and help build impactful applications.

I've been working remotely as a Front-end developer since 2020 and my current stack is based on Typescript, Angular, C#, .NET. But I also, love discovering new technologies and sometimes create software using React, React Native, NextJS, and NodeJS. Most of my code is in private repositories on other platforms because I work with financial institutions with LGPD.
