### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I am a Brazilian Software Engineer and my purpose is to create a better world by building impactful applications.

After acquiring some experience in digital marketing working with global teams for clients like Google, I attended Le Wagon's coding Bootcamp in Lisbon (Portugal) in order to understand the programming universe and help build impactful applications.

I've been working remotely as a frontend developer since 2020 and my current stack is based on JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, AngularJS, ReactJS, and React Native. But also, I love discovering new technologies.
